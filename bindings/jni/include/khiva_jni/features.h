/**
* @brief Calculates the value of the partial autocorrelation function at the given lag. The lag \f$k\f$ partial

\f$x_t\f$ and \f$x_{t-k}\f$, adjusted for the intermediate variables \f$\lbrace x_{t-1}, \ldots, x_{t-k+1}
\rbrace\f$ ([1]). Following [2], it can be defined as:
*
* \f[
\alpha_k = \frac{ Cov(x_t, x_{t-k} | x_{t-1}, \ldots, x_{t-k+1})}

being AR(k-1) models that can be fitted by OLS. Be aware that in (a), the regression is done on past values to
predict \f$ x_t \f$ whereas in (b), future values are used to calculate the past value \f$x_{t-k}\f$.
It is said in [1] that "for an AR(p), the partial autocorrelations \f$ \alpha_k \f$ will be nonzero for \f$ k<=p \f$
and zero for \f$ k>p \f$."
* With this property, it is used to determine the lag of an AR-Process.
