/**
 * @brief Calculates a linear least-squares regression for two sets of measurements. Both arrays should have the same
 * length.
 *
 * @param ref_xss Expects an input array whose dimension zero is the length of the time series (all the same) and
 * dimension one indicates the number of time series.
 * @param ref_yss Expects an input array whose dimension zero is the length of the time series (all the same) and
 * dimension one indicates the number of time series.
 *
 * @return An array with the updated refs and refs to:
 *      {
 *          slope Slope of the regression line.
 *          intercept Intercept of the regression line.
 *          rvalue Correlation coefficient.
 *          pvalue Two-sided p-value for a hypothesis test whose null hypothesis is that the slope is zero, using Wald
 *                  Test with t-distribution of the test statistic.
 *          stderrest Standard error of the estimated gradient.
 *      }
